This repository showcases a subtle bug related to implicit type conversion in Python. The function `function_with_uncommon_error` aims to handle division by zero gracefully, returning infinity when the divisor is zero. However, if the input `a` is an integer and `b` is zero, the function's behaviour might not be entirely predictable.  The code highlights the need for explicit type handling in critical scenarios. The `bugSolution.py` shows the resolution to ensure proper error handling and predictable results.
